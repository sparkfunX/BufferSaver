[*SPI Buffer Saver (SPX-14973)*](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/14973)

The SPI Buffer Saver increases the speed at which you can refresh SPI data without having to modify the Arduino core libraries. It works by rerouting the MOSI channel onto the MISO channel when the chip select pin is active using a tri-state buffer.
The same method can be used to switch other signals so take a peek at the schematic and try it out yourself!
